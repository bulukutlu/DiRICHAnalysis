\subsection*{Prerequisites}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item root
\item cmake
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Installation}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Go to your favorite destination
\item {\ttfamily git clone \href{https://github.com/tklemenz/RadMapAnalysis}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/tklemenz/\+Rad\+Map\+Analysis}}
\item source your {\ttfamily thisroot.\+sh}
\item {\ttfamily source Rad\+Map\+Analysis/compile.\+sh}
\item It\textquotesingle{}s that easy
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{How to use it}

When you want to open a root file containing objects from the framework you need to load the Rad\+Map\+Analysis.\+so (.dylib if you\textquotesingle{}re a mac disciple) library.

The easiest way I found for now is to create an alias in your {\ttfamily $\sim$/.bashrc} where the library is loaded when you call {\ttfamily root}. It could look something like this\+:

{\ttfamily alias rad\+R\+O\+OT=\textquotesingle{}root -\/l -\/e \char`\"{}g\+System-\/$>$\+Load(\textbackslash{}\char`\"{}/path/to/\+Rad\+Map\+Analysis/build/lib\+Rad\+Map\+Ana.so");"\textquotesingle{}}

Then you can simply call {\ttfamily rad\+R\+O\+OT} and the objects from the framework are known to root.

\section*{General stuff}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item compile.\+sh should not be changed!
\item Executables will be located in the bin folder.
\item As the only style guide I would suggest to N\+OT use tab but only spaces. Otherwise the code looks horrible in different editors...
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please only commit the following files or files in the following folders if changes were made (gitignore should take care of that)\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt
\item include
\item src
\item macros
\item R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md
\end{DoxyItemize}

Do N\+OT commit\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item bin
\item build
\end{DoxyItemize}

Feel free to not only add macros but also add missing functionality to the classes or create new classes that you think are necessary.

If you don\textquotesingle{}t know how to add classes and/or macros just go along the lines of the \hyperlink{classDummy}{Dummy} (add to Link\+Def and C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt etc...).

Thanks for contributing!!
